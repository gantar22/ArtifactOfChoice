# ArtifactOfChoice
A mod based on the item Artifact of Command from Risk of Rain. When you acquire a combat reward or purchase an item from the shop, you may replace the item with another from the same tier and color. Some configurations are available. This mod isn't balanced (like not remotely). Why replay the same game over and over until you finally get the perfect build, when you can get the perfect build every game!


Credit to Bug Kiooeht for making the Hubris mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1609159603) from which I adapted the backtick relic's selection UI.
